Play numerous Unreal Engine games from your Steam or EPIC library in Virtual Reality, such as with Meta Quest headsets.
This app takes [Praydogâ€™s brilliant (UEVR)](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR) magic module, but replaces the UI part with a user-friendly, new one.   
It adds features like an **online profiles database, voice commands, user friendly profiles editor and UEVR Nightly updates with one click**.  
UEVR for the casual user, mass market compatible  ;-)

## Easy to find a Profile and start the Game, including XR Runtime Switcher
The new UEVR profile database includes documentation for each profile. No more searching on Discord or outdated profile websites
(but you can still use them with UEVR Easy Injector, just like you would use them with UEVR Classic). 
Inject via hotkey while running your game, without needing to tab around with your headset on.
