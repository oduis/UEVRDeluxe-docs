## How to submit a UEVR Easy Injector game profile to the online database
You have built a battle-tested, working profile? This is how to publish it to the community, so everyone can enjoy your work:

### 1. Test it to make sure quality is good
Many games run with some little glitches, but test it before submitting:
- Play the game yourself for more than just 5 minutes (in case it crashes e.g. later on cutscenes etc.)
- Even better: Have the community on [Discord UE-Games](https://discord.com/channels/747967102895390741/1062167556129030164) test it

### 2. Add descriptions and metadata
Many games need special graphic settings to look good in VR, or need some remarks on what workarounds are needed for glitches. Add this information in the "Edit profile". 
It is stored in the files ```ProfileMeta.json``` and ```ProfileDescription.md``` which you can edit directly without GUI. 

### 3. Publish the full profile as Zip
After having added the description, hit the "Publish" button again. UEVR Easy Injector will check some basics, delete temporary files like crash dumps and logs, and pack up a ZIP for you.  
The packed profile will have some settings resetted that might be user dependent (e.g. log level, enable depth buffer), but if will leave your local profile alone. So it is NOT the same as zipping the folder yourself ;-).

### 4. Submit on Discord
Now post this to the [Discord UE-general channel](https://discord.com/channels/747967102895390741/947806014344925274). Add the two UEVR Easy Injector admins @Pande4360 and @ODuis to make sure it's read. We'll check it briefly and upload it to the clouds database.  
  
### :-) Thanks for helping the community!
